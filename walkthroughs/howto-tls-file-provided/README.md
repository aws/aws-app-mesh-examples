# Configuring TLS with File Provided TLS Certificates

In this walkthrough we'll enable TLS encryption between two services in App Mesh using X.509 certificates packaged with your envoy application. This walkthrough will be a simplified version of the [Color App Example](https://github.com/aws/aws-app-mesh-examples/tree/master/examples/apps/colorapp).

## Introduction

In App Mesh, traffic encryption works between Virtual Nodes, and thus between Envoys in your service mesh. This means your application code is not responsible for negotiating a TLS-encrypted session, instead allowing the local proxy to negotiate and terminate TLS on your application's behalf.

App Mesh allows you to provide the TLS Certificate to envoy in a couple different ways
1. through a Secret Discovery Service call to App Mesh to get ACM provided certificates
1. Through a secret discovery request to your own SDS
1. Through a file path accessible to your envoy

In this guide, we will be configuring Envoy to use the file based strategy. 


## Step 1: Download the App Mesh Preview CLI

You will need the latest version of the App Mesh Preview CLI for this walkthrough. You can download and use the latest version using the command below.

```bash
aws configure add-model \
        --service-name appmesh-preview \
        --service-model https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-app-mesh-roadmap/master/appmesh-preview/service-model.json
```

Additionally, this walkthrough makes use of the unix command line utility `jq`. If you don't already have it, you can install it from [here](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

## Step 2: Create Color App Infrastructure

We'll start by setting up the basic infrastructure for our services. All commands will be provided as if run from the same directory as this README.

You'll need a keypair stored in AWS to access a bastion host. You can create a keypair using the command below if you don't have one. See [Amazon EC2 Key Pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html).

```bash
aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name color-app | jq -r .KeyMaterial > ~/.ssh/color-app.pem
```

This command creates an Amazon EC2 Key Pair with name `color-app` and saves the private key at
`~/.ssh/color-app.pem`. `

Next, we need to set a few environment variables before provisioning the
infrastructure. Please change the value for `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`, `KEY_PAIR_NAME`, and `ENVOY_IMAGE` below.

```bash
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=<your account id>
export KEY_PAIR_NAME=<color-app or your SSH key pair stored in AWS>
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
export ENVIRONMENT_NAME=AppMeshTLSExample
export MESH_NAME=ColorApp-TLS
export AWS_ENVOY_IMAGE=<get the latest from https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/envoy.html>
export SERVICES_DOMAIN="default.svc.cluster.local"
export GATEWAY_IMAGE_NAME="gateway"
export COLOR_TELLER_IMAGE_NAME="colorteller"
```

First, create the VPC.

```bash
./infrastructure/vpc.sh
```

Next, create the ECS cluster and ECR repositories.

```bash
./infrastructure/ecs-cluster.sh
./infrastructure/ecr-repositories.sh
```

Next, build and deploy the color app images.

```bash
./src/colorteller/deploy.sh
./src/gateway/deploy.sh
```

## Step 3: Generate the Certficates

Before we can encrypt traffic between services in the mesh, we need to generate our certificates.

```
./src/customEnvoyImage/keys/certs.sh
```

This generates a few different files

- *_cert.pem: These files are the public side of our certificates
- *_key.pem: these files are the private key for the certificates
- *_cert_chain: 
- ca_1_ca_2_bundle.pem: This file contains the public certificates for both CAs.

You can verify that the certificate was signed by the CA using this command
```
openssl verify -verbose -CAfile ca_1_cert.pem colorteller_white_cert.pem
```

## Step 4: Export our Custom Docker Image

Finally, we can build and deploy our custom docker image:
```
./src/colorteller/envoy/deploy.sh
```
The script will print the location of the envoy image. Export it as:

```
export ENVOY_IMAGE=<output of last command>
```

## Step 5: Create a Mesh with TLS enabled

We are going to start with a single colorteller enabled.

Let's create the mesh.

```bash
./mesh/mesh.sh up
```

The Virtual Node spec for the white colorteller looks like:

```
{
    "spec": {
        "listeners": [
            {
                "portMapping": {
                    "port": 9080,
                    "protocol": "http"
                },
                ...
                "tls": {
                    "mode": "STRICT",
                    "certificate": {
                        "file": {
                            "certificateChain": "/keys/colorteller_white_cert_chain.pem",
                            "privateKey": "/keys/colorteller_white_key.pem"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
    }
    ...
}
```

The `tls` block specifies where the envoy can find the certificates it expects.


## Step 6: Deploy and Verify

Now with the mesh defined, we can deploy our service to ECS and test it out.

```bash
./infrastructure/ecs-service.sh
```

Let's issue a request to the color gateway.

```bash
COLORAPP_ENDPOINT=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name $ENVIRONMENT_NAME-ecs-service \
    | jq -r '.Stacks[0].Outputs[] | select(.OutputKey=="ColorAppEndpoint") | .OutputValue')
curl "${COLORAPP_ENDPOINT}/color"
```

You should see a successful response with the color white.

Finally, let's log in to the bastion host and check the SSL handshake statistics.

```bash
BASTION_IP=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name $ENVIRONMENT_NAME-ecs-cluster \
    | jq -r '.Stacks[0].Outputs[] | select(.OutputKey=="BastionIP") | .OutputValue')
ssh ec2-user@$BASTION_IP
curl -s http://colorteller.default.svc.cluster.local:9901/stats | grep ssl.handshake
```

You should see output similar to: `listener.0.0.0.0_15000.ssl.handshake: 1`, indicating a successful SSL handshake was achieved between gateway and color teller.

# Client Validation Tutorial

Enabling TLS communication from your virtual node is the first step to securing your traffic. In a zero trust system, the color gateway is also responsible for saying what certificates are trusted. App Mesh allows you to configure Envoy with information on what CAs you trust to vend certificates. We will demonstrate this by adding a new color teller to our service that has a TLS certificate vended from a different CA than the first.

## Step 1.

This first step will first add a new virtual node, the Green Color Teller. The TLS configuration looks almost identical to the first, but now we are using the `colorteller_green` related certificates

```
"tls": {
    "mode": "STRICT",
    "certificate": {
        "file": {
            "certificateChain": "/keys/colorteller_green_cert_chain.pem",
            "privateKey": "/keys/colorteller_green_key.pem"
        }
    }
}
```

We will also need to update our route to serve traffic to both color tellers:

```
{
    "spec": {
        "httpRoute": {
            "action": {
                "weightedTargets": [
                    {
                        "virtualNode": "colorteller-white-vn",
                        "weight": 1
                    },
                    {
                        "virtualNode": "colorteller-green-vn",
                        "weight": 1
                    }
                ]
            },
            "match": {
                "prefix": "/"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Run `./mesh/mesh.sh addGreen` to add this to your mesh.

Now when you run `curl "${COLORAPP_ENDPOINT}/color"` you will see both `white` and `green` in the responses.

### Step #: Add TLS Validation to the Gateway

As you just saw, we were able to add a new Virtual Node with TLS to our mesh and the Color Gateway was able to communicate with it no problem. By default, App Mesh configures your services to maintain communication. 

If you recall, the Green Color Teller certificates were signed by a different CA than the White Color Teller certificates.  Perhaps this is not the intended behavior and we want to reject certificates from any CA that is not CA 1. 

We are going to update the Color Gateway backend to have this configuration:
```
"backends": [
    {
        "virtualService": 
        {
            "virtualServiceName": $COLOR_TELLER_VS,
            "clientPolicy": {
                "tls": {
                    "validation": {
                        "trust": {
                            "file": {
                                "certificateChain": "/keys/ca_1_cert.pem"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
]
```

This will only allow certificates signed by CA 1 to be accepted.

```
./mesh/mesh.sh updateGateway
```  

Now when you run `curl "${COLORAPP_ENDPOINT}/color"` you will see both `white` is working properly, but you will start to see <insert the error here> from the Green Colorteller.

### Fix communication

We can restore communication by changing the `certificateChain` in the backend group to be `ca_1_ca_2_bundle.pem`. This contains both the certificates public certificates for CA 1 and CA 2, which will allow communication to the Green Color Teller to resume.
 
```
./mesh/mesh.sh updateGateway2
```

Now running `curl "${COLORAPP_ENDPOINT}/color"` will return green again.


If you want to keep the application running, you can do so, but this is the end of this walkthrough.
Run the following commands to clean up and tear down the resources that weâ€™ve created.

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name $ENVIRONMENT_NAME-ecs-service
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name $ENVIRONMENT_NAME-ecs-cluster
aws ecr delete-repository --force --repository-name colorteller
aws ecr delete-repository --force --repository-name gateway
aws ecr delete-repository --force --repository-name colorteller-envoy
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name $ENVIRONMENT_NAME-ecr-repositories
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name $ENVIRONMENT_NAME-vpc
```

Delete the mesh.

```bash
./mesh/mesh.sh down
```

And finally delete the certificates.
