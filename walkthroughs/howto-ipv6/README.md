# Walkthrough of IPv6 in App Mesh

## Overview

In this walkthrough we'll be setting up applications with different IP version capabilites and configuring App Mesh resources to see how they impact these applications.

- **IP Preferences:** With the introduction of IPv6 support in App Mesh a new IP preference field has been added to meshes and virtual nodes. IP preferences will impact how Envoy configuration gets generated. The four possible values for IP preferences are the following.

    * `IPv4_ONLY`
    * `IPv4_PREFERRED`
    * `IPv6_ONLY`
    * `IPv6_PREFERRED`

- **Meshes:** Adding an IP preference to a mesh impacts how Envoy configuration will be generated for all virtual nodes and virtual gateways within the mesh. A sample mesh spec that includes an IP preference can be seen below.

	```json
    "spec": {
        "serviceDiscovery": {
            "ipPreference": "IPv6_PREFERRED"
        }
    }
	```
	
- **Virtual Nodes**: Adding an IP preference to a virtual node will change how Envoy configuration gets generated for that specific virtual node. Additionally it will change how Envoy configruation for virtual gateways and virtual nodes that are routing traffic to that virtual node. (ex. virtual node backends or gateway routes) A sample virtual node spec that includes an IP preference can be seen below.
    
    ```json
    "spec": {
        "listeners": [
            {
                "healthCheck": {
                    "healthyThreshold": 2,
                    "intervalMillis": 5000,
                    "path": "/ping",
                    "protocol": "http",
                    "timeoutMillis": 2000,
                    "unhealthyThreshold": 2
                },
                "portMapping": {
                    "port": 9080,
                    "protocol": "http"
                }
            }
        ],
        "serviceDiscovery": {
            "dns": {
                "hostname": "colorteller-red.default.svc.cluster.local",
                "ipPreference": "IPv4_ONLY"
            }
        }
    }
    ```
 

## Setup
For this walkthrough there are two setups that can be created. One setup utilizes an NLB to forward traffic to a virtual gateway. The virtual gateway will then forward the traffic to virtual nodes in the mesh via gateway routes. The other setup utilizes an ALB to forward traffic to a virtual node. The virtual node will then forward traffic to backend virtual nodes.

## Step 1: Prerequisites


1. This walkthrough makes use of the unix command line utility `jq`. If you don't already have it, you can install it from [here](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

2. Install Docker. It is needed to build the demo application images.

3. You'll need a keypair stored in AWS to access a bastion host. You can create a keypair using the command below if you don't have one. See [Amazon EC2 Key Pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html).

```bash
aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name app-mesh-ip | jq -r .KeyMaterial > ~/.ssh/app-mesh-ip.pem
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/app-mesh-ip.pem
```

This command creates an Amazon EC2 Key Pair with name `app-mesh-ip` and saves the private key at
`~/.ssh/app-mesh-ip.pem`.

4. Your AWS account will need to enable dual stack IPv6 tasks for ECS. Without enabling this ECS tasks will not be given IPv6 addresses when they are created. Enabling the setting can be done by running the following command. This command applies to the entire AWS account and only needs to be run once to enable this setting for all regions.

```bash
aws ecs put-account-setting-default --name dualStackIPv6 --value enabled
```

See [ECS Account Settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/ecs-account-settings.html) for further information about this setting.

## Step 2: Set Environment Variables
We need to set a few environment variables before provisioning the
infrastructure. Please change the value for `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`, `KEY_PAIR_NAME`, and `ENVOY_IMAGE` below.

```bash
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=<your-account-id>
export ENVOY_IMAGE=<get the latest from https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/envoy.html>
export KEY_PAIR_NAME=<app-mesh-ip or your key pair stored in AWS>
```

Set the following environment variables specific to the walkthrough:

```bash
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
export PROJECT_NAME=app-mesh-ipv6
export MESH_NAME=app-mesh-ipv6
export SERVICES_DOMAIN="default.svc.cluster.local"
```

These variables are also stored in `vars.env` and you can easily set them by setting the appropriate values in `vars.env` and then running `source ./vars.env`!

## Step 3: Create Infrastructure

We'll start by setting up the basic infrastructure for our services. All commands will be provided as if run from the same directory as this README.

The following command will create a VPC, ECR repositories and an ECS cluster.

```bash
./deploy.sh infra
```

Note that the example app used in this walkthrough uses go modules. If you have trouble accessing https://proxy.golang.org during the deployment you can override the GOPROXY by setting `GO_PROXY=direct`

```bash
GO_PROXY=direct ./deploy.sh infra
```

Once you the infrastructure has been deployed you should see output like the following.

```bash
Bastion endpoint:
12.345.6.789
```

Save the bastion endpoint for use later.
```bash
export BASTION_IP=<your_bastion_endpoint e.g. 12.245.6.189>
```

## Step 4: Deploy ECS Service
Both setups in this walkthrough create ECS services which utilize the same infrastructure and can be set up alongside each other. You can choose to deploy both setups at the same time or just one at a time. Use the commands given for the setup you are interested in for the following sections. After each of these commands is run, output such as the following will be seen

```bash
Successfully created/updated stack - app-mesh-ipv6-vg-ecs-service
Public endpoint:
http://app-m-Publi-55555555.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
```

We will want to save this endpoint for use later by doing something such as the following.
```bash
export COLORAPP_ENDPOINT=<your_http_colorApp_endpoint e.g. http://app-m-Publi-55555555.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com>
```

If you are deploying both setups then you will want to save each endpoint separately. (ex. COLORAPP_CLOUD_ENDPOINT, COLORAPP_DNS_ENDPOINT) You will need to change later commands if you have both deployed as well.

### CloudMap Service Discovery

```bash
./deploy.sh cloud-service
```

### DNS Service Discovery

```bash
./deploy.sh dns-service
```

## Step 5: Test Sending Traffic in the Initial Setup
The initial setup is using a mesh preference of V4_ONLY. This will apply a V4_ONLY preference to all virtual nodes. Let us see how this impacts traffic being sent to applications.

Try 
```bash
curl "${COLORAPP_ENDPOINT}/red"
```
 and see if the service correctly gives you the color red back. 

For the red service, it is discoverable via IPv4 and 

Try 
```bash
curl "${COLORAPP_ENDPOINT}/yellow"
```
 and see if an upstream connection error occurs. (503) 

You can try all of the following colors as well and get these results

* orange - get back orange
* green - get back green
* blue - get back blue
* purple - upstream connection error

## Step 6: Test out Different IP Preferences

You can now change the IP preference set on the mesh and additionally add IP preferences to each virtual node to see how it affects each color service. Preferences can be changed by changing the `.json` files in the either `/vg/mesh` or `vn/mesh` depending on which setup you are using. Then running the mesh update script `/vg/mesh/update-mesh.sh` or `/vn/mesh/update-mesh.sh`.


## Step 7: Clean Up

Run the following commands to clean up and tear down the resources that weâ€™ve created.

Delete the CloudMap service discovery setup if you deployed it:
```bash
./deploy.sh delete-cloud-service
```

Delete the DNS service discovery setup if you deployed it:
```bash
./deploy.sh delete-dns-service
```

Delete the infrastructure after you have torn down your setup(s):
```bash
./deploy.sh delete-infra
```
