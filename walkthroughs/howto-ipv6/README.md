# Walkthrough of IPv6 in App Mesh

## Overview

In this walkthrough we'll be setting up applications with different IP version capabilites and configuring App Mesh resources to see how they impact these applications.

### IP Preferences in Meshes and Virtual Nodes

With the introduction of IPv6 support in App Mesh a new IP preference field has been added to meshes and virtual nodes. IP preferences impact how Envoy configuration gets generated with repsect to how the Envoy handles traffic for different IP versions. There are four possible values for the IP preference field which can be set both on meshes and virtual nodes and they are the following.

  * `IPv4_ONLY`: only use IPv4
  * `IPv4_PREFERRED`:  prefer IPv4 and fall back to IPv6
  * `IPv6_ONLY`: only use IPv6
  * `IPv6_PREFERRED`: prefer IPv6 and fall back to IPv4  

This field is not required to be present for both meshes and virtual nodes. Users can have `No Preference` by not specifying the field. The behavior of the different IP preferences and `No Preference` will be further outlined later in this overview. 

- **Meshes:** Adding an IP preference to a mesh impacts how Envoy configuration will be generated for all virtual nodes and virtual gateways within the mesh. A sample mesh spec that includes an IP preference can be seen below.

    ```json
    "spec": {
        "serviceDiscovery": {
            "ipPreference": "IPv6_PREFERRED"
        }
    }
    ```
	
- **Virtual Nodes**: Adding an IP preference to a virtual node will change how Envoy configuration gets generated for that specific virtual node. Additionally it will change how Envoy configruation for virtual gateways and virtual nodes that are routing traffic to that virtual node. (ex. virtual node backends or gateway routes) If an IP preference is present on both the mesh and a virtual node, then the IP preference setting on virtual node will override the mesh preference and be used to generate the Envoy configuration for this specific virtual node. A sample virtual node spec that includes an IP preference can be seen below.
    
    ```json
    "spec": {
        "listeners": [
            {
                "healthCheck": {
                    "healthyThreshold": 2,
                    "intervalMillis": 5000,
                    "path": "/ping",
                    "protocol": "http",
                    "timeoutMillis": 2000,
                    "unhealthyThreshold": 2
                },
                "portMapping": {
                    "port": 9080,
                    "protocol": "http"
                }
            }
        ],
        "serviceDiscovery": {
            "dns": {
                "hostname": "colorteller-red.default.svc.cluster.local",
                "ipPreference": "IPv4_ONLY"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

### How IP Preferences Impact Envoy Configuration

- **Service Discovery**: If a user configures **Service Discovery** on a virtual node (**DNS** or **AWS Cloud Map**), then the different IP preference settings will affect each service discovery option differently. For AWS Cloud Map service discovery, the IP address returned by Cloud Map that is used within Envoy configuration will change. For DNS service discovery, how the DNS resolver is configured for Envoy will change based on IP preferences.     
- **Envoy Listener Configuration Binding Address**:  Envoy will only accept and handle traffic for the addresses that its listeners are told to bind to. If an IP preference is set either on the mesh or virtual node itself, then the resulting listener generated within a virtual node's Envoy listener configuration will bind to all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for both ingress and egress traffic. Otherwise, without any IP preference set the Envoy listeners will only bind to all IPv4 addresses.  
- **Envoy Cluster Configuration Local Application Address**: Envoys that are running as a sidecar to an application are configured to send traffic to the application by defining an endpoint that uses a loopback address as the applicationâ€™s IP address. Only a single address can be defined for this purpose and it will be either the IPv4 loopback address (127.0.0.1) or IPv6 loopback address (::1).

|	|Service Discovery: DNS |Service Discovery: AWS Cloud Map |Envoy Cluster Configuration: Local Application Address	| Envoy Listener Configuration Binding Address (Ingress/Egress) |
|---	|---	|---	|---	|---  |
|`No Preference` | Envoy's DNS resolver will prefer IPv6 and fall back to IPv4  |We will use the IPv4 address returned by CloudMap if available and fall back to using the IPv6 address |The endpoint created for the local app will use an IPv4 address |The Envoy will bind to all IPv4 addresses |
|`IPv4_PREFERRED` | Envoy's DNS resolver will prefer IPv4 and fall back to IPv6  |We will use the IPv4 address returned by CloudMap if available and fall back to using the IPv6 address |The endpoint created for the local app will use an IPv4 address |The Envoy will bind to all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses |
|`IPv6_PREFERRED` | Envoy's DNS resolver will prefer IPv6 and fall back to IPv4  |We will use the IPv6 address returned by CloudMap if available and fall back to using the IPv4 address |The endpoint created for the local app will use an IPv6 address |The Envoy will bind to all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses |
|`IPv4_ONLY` | Envoy's DNS resolver will only use IPv4  |We will only use the IPv4 address returned by CloudMap |The endpoint created for the local app will use an IPv4 address |The Envoy will bind to all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses |
|`IPv6_ONLY` | Envoy's DNS resolver will only use IPv6  |We will only use the IPv6 address returned by CloudMap |The endpoint created for the local app will use an IPv6 address |The Envoy will bind to all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses |

## Setup
For this walkthrough a variation of the Color App setup is being used as the application. An Application Load Balancer (ALB) is being used to forward traffic to a virtual gateway which then forwards the traffic to various virtual nodes in the mesh via gateway routes. In this walkthrough there are two possible setups that can be used. The primary difference between these setups is the service discovery that is being used for the virtual nodes within the setup. One of the setups uses DNS service discovery and the other uses AWS Cloud Map service discovery.

![Images](setup_graph.png)

In each setup there are six different virtual nodes which have different combinations of the following two variables:
1. **Service Discovery**: whether the service cab be discovered by IPv4 only, IPv6 only or both. This helps with testing the behavior of the `Service Discovery` columns from table above.
2. **Application compatibility**: the application only will listen for only IPv4, only IPv6 or both types of traffic. This helps with testing the behavior of `Envoy Cluster Configuration: Local Application Address` from the table above.

With a combination of these two settings the request can fail for two general cases outlined in the following examples based on the setup in this walkthrough:
1. The virtual gateway Envoy will use different IP versions to forward traffic depending on the IP preference set on the mesh and virtual nodes. If the virtual gateway Envoy should route traffic to an ECS task that not discoverable then the Envoy will not be able to forward the traffic.
For example, if traffic is being forwarded to the `colorteller-yellow-vn` with the IP preference `IPv6_ONLY` being applied then a failure will occur since the task for the yellow service is only discoverable via IPv4. With an IP preference of `IPv6_ONLY` the Envoy will not fall back to using IPv4 when it can't find the task using IPv6. For Cloud Map, not being discoverable via IPv6 would mean that no IPv6 addresses for the task have been registered in Cloud Map. For DNS service discovery, not being discoverable via IPv6 would mean that no valid AAAA records for the domain name being used can be found by Envoy's DNS resolver. 
2. After the traffic is forwarded to any of the virtual nodes' Envoys, the connection can still fail if the Envoy sends traffic to the local application using an IP version that the application doesn't support.   
For example, `colorteller-green-vn` is using an application which only supports IPv4 traffic. If an IP preference of `IPv6_PREFERRED` is being applied to this virtual node, then the request will fail because the Envoy will use an IPv6 address to connect to application causing the application to reject the request.  
Note that even when an IP preference of `IPv6_PREFERRED` is used, the Envoy won't fall back to using IPv4 automatically. The Envoy will only try using a single address to connect to the local application and the error will still occur regardless of using a `PREFERRED` or `ONLY` preference.

The following table describes how we set these two variables for all six virtual nodes and expected result after making curl requests.

## Step 1: Prerequisites


1. This walkthrough makes use of the unix command line utility `jq`. If you don't already have it, you can install it from [here](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

2. Install Docker. It is needed to build the demo application images.

3. Set the AWS region that you will be running this walkthrough in. Change the following command below if you would like to run this walkthrough in a region other than `us-west-2`.
```
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
```

4. You'll need a keypair stored in AWS to access a bastion host. You can create a keypair using the command below if you don't have one. See [Amazon EC2 Key Pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html).

```bash
aws ec2 create-key-pair --region $AWS_DEFAULT_REGION --key-name app-mesh-ip | jq -r .KeyMaterial > ~/.ssh/app-mesh-ip.pem
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/app-mesh-ip.pem
```

This command creates an Amazon EC2 Key Pair with name `app-mesh-ip` and saves the private key at
`~/.ssh/app-mesh-ip.pem`.

5. Your AWS account will need to enable dual stack IPv6 tasks for ECS. Without enabling this ECS tasks will not be given IPv6 addresses when they are created. Enabling the setting can be done by running the following command.

```bash
aws ecs put-account-setting-default --name dualStackIPv6 --value enabled --region $AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
```

See [ECS Account Settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/ecs-account-settings.html) for further information about this setting.

## Step 2: Set Environment Variables
We need to set a few environment variables before provisioning the
infrastructure. Please change the value for `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`, `KEY_PAIR_NAME`, and `ENVOY_IMAGE` below.

```bash
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=<your-account-id>
export ENVOY_IMAGE=<get the latest from https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/envoy.html>
export KEY_PAIR_NAME=<app-mesh-ip or your key pair stored in AWS>
```

Set the following environment variables specific to the walkthrough:

```bash
export PROJECT_NAME=app-mesh-ipv6
export MESH_NAME=app-mesh-ipv6
export SERVICES_DOMAIN="default.svc.cluster.local"
```

These variables are also stored in `vars.env` and you can easily set them by setting the appropriate values in `vars.env` and then running `source ./vars.env`!

## Step 3: Create Infrastructure

We'll start by setting up the basic infrastructure for our services. All commands will be provided as if run from the same directory as this README.

The following command will create a VPC, ECR repositories and an ECS cluster.

```bash
./deploy.sh infra
```

Note that the example app used in this walkthrough uses go modules. If you have trouble accessing https://proxy.golang.org during the deployment you can override the GOPROXY by setting `GO_PROXY=direct`

```bash
GO_PROXY=direct ./deploy.sh infra
```

Once you the infrastructure has been deployed you should see output like the following.

```bash
Bastion endpoint:
12.345.6.789
```

Save the bastion endpoint for use later.
```bash
export BASTION_IP=<your_bastion_endpoint e.g. 12.245.6.189>
```

## Step 4: Deploy ECS Service
Both setups in this walkthrough create ECS services which utilize the same infrastructure and can be set up alongside each other. You can choose to deploy both setups at the same time or just one at a time. Use the commands given for the setup you are interested in for the following sections. After each of these commands is run, output such as the following will be seen

```bash
Successfully created/updated stack - app-mesh-ipv6-vg-ecs-service
Public endpoint:
http://app-m-Publi-55555555.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
```

We will want to save this endpoint for use later by doing something such as the following.
```bash
export COLORAPP_ENDPOINT=<your_http_colorApp_endpoint e.g. http://app-m-Publi-55555555.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com>
```

If you are deploying both setups then you will want to save each endpoint separately. (ex. COLORAPP_CLOUD_ENDPOINT, COLORAPP_DNS_ENDPOINT) You will need to change later commands if you have both deployed as well.

### CloudMap Service Discovery

```bash
./deploy.sh cloud-service
```

### DNS Service Discovery

```bash
./deploy.sh dns-service
```

## Step 5: Test Sending Traffic in the Initial Setup
The initial setup is using a mesh preference of `IPv4_ONLY`. This will apply a `IPv4_ONLY` preference to all virtual nodes. Let us see how this impacts traffic being sent to applications.

**Note: If you execute the following commands after recently deploying then it may not work and time out. The load balancer will need some time to initialize the target group that is pointing to the virtual gateway. While the target group is initializing all requests will fail.**

Try 
```bash
curl "${COLORAPP_ENDPOINT}/red"
```
 and see if the service correctly gives you the color red back. 

**Why did this request succeed?**
The red service is discoverable via IPv4 and the virtual gateway can send it traffic given the current preference is `IPv4_ONLY`. Once the Envoy recieves the request it will send the request to the application via an IPv4 address. This address is compatible with the application because it can recieve IPv4 traffic.

Try 
```bash
curl "${COLORAPP_ENDPOINT}/yellow"
```
 and see if an upstream connection error occurs. (503) 

**Why did this request fail?**
The yellow service is discoverable via IPv4 and the virtual gateway can send it traffic given the current preference is `IPv4_ONLY`. However, once the Envoy recieves the request it will send the request to the application via an IPv4 address. This address is not compatible with the application because it can only recieve IPv6 traffic. This results in a connection error.

You can also try all of the following colors as well and get these results

* orange - get back orange
* green - get back green
* blue - get back blue
* purple - upstream connection error

Additionally we can check that the Envoy has identified the services that it can send traffic to as healthy. We can do this by logging into the bastion host and checking the virtual gateway Envoy's admin interface. 

First let's log into the bastion host. If you used an already existing key pair or stored you key pair from [Prerequisites](#step-1-prerequisites) step 4 in a different location then change the command below to reflect this.
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/app-mesh-ip.pem ec2-user@$BASTION_IP
```

Now that we are logged into the bastion host. We can use the Envoy admin interface to check which services have been identified as healthy using one of the commands below depending on which setup you are using.

CloudMap Service Discovery
```bash
curl -s http://colorgateway.default.svc.cluster.local.cloud:9901/stats | grep health_check.healthy
```

DNS Service Discovery
```bash
curl -s http://colorgateway.default.svc.cluster.local.dns:9901/stats | grep health_check.healthy
```

After running this command you should see output similar to the one seen below. A value of `1` indicates healthy and a value of `0` indicates unhealthy. The services that are healthy and unhealthy should line up with which services you can get responses from when using curl.

```
cluster.cds_egress_app-mesh-ipv6-cloud-mesh_colorteller-blue-vn_http_9080.health_check.healthy: 1
cluster.cds_egress_app-mesh-ipv6-cloud-mesh_colorteller-green-vn_http_9080.health_check.healthy: 1
cluster.cds_egress_app-mesh-ipv6-cloud-mesh_colorteller-orange-vn_http_9080.health_check.healthy: 1
cluster.cds_egress_app-mesh-ipv6-cloud-mesh_colorteller-purple-vn_http_9080.health_check.healthy: 0
cluster.cds_egress_app-mesh-ipv6-cloud-mesh_colorteller-red-vn_http_9080.health_check.healthy: 1
cluster.cds_egress_app-mesh-ipv6-cloud-mesh_colorteller-yellow-vn_http_9080.health_check.healthy: 0
```

## Step 6: Test out a Different Mesh IP Preference

Let us now change the IP preference set on the mesh to `IPv6_ONLY`. Running the following command for your respective setup will update the CloudFormation stack deployed and update the mesh IP preference from `IPv4_ONLY` to `IPv6_ONLY`.

CloudMap Service Discovery
```bash
./deploy.sh update-mesh cloud v6_only
```

DNS Service Discovery
```bash
./deploy.sh update-mesh dns v6_only
```

**Note: All updates to your App Mesh resources (mesh and virtual nodes) will take some time to take effect. You will likely need to wait a little bit before the changes take place. However, this should not take longer than a few minutes.**

Once the update has been made we can send traffic to the services again.

Try 
```bash
curl "${COLORAPP_ENDPOINT}/purple"
```
 and see if the service correctly gives you the color purple back. 

**Why did this request succeed?**
The purple service is discoverable via IPv4 and IPv6 and the virtual gateway can send it traffic given the current preference is `IPv6_ONLY`. Once the Envoy recieves the request it will send the request to the application via an IPv6 address. This address is compatible with the application because it can recieve IPv6 traffic.

Try 
```bash
curl "${COLORAPP_ENDPOINT}/green"
```
 and see if an upstream connection error occurs. (503) 

**Why did this request fail?**
The green service is discoverable via IPv4 and IPv6 and the virtual gateway can send it traffic given the current preference is `IPv6_ONLY`. However, once the Envoy recieves the request it will send the request to the application via an IPv6 address. This address is not compatible with the application because it can only recieve IPv4 traffic. This results in a connection error.

Try 
```bash
curl "${COLORAPP_ENDPOINT}/red"
```
 and see if a connection error occur due to no healthy upstreams. 

**Why did this request fail?**
The red service is discoverable via IPv4 and the virtual gateway cannot send it traffic given the current preference is `IPv6_ONLY`. For CloudMap service discovery, there are no IPv6 address that is being registered. For DNS service discovery, there are no AAAA records being registered. As a result the virtual gateway does not have an IP address to route traffic to.

You can also try all of the following colors as well and get these results

* orange - no healthy upstream
* yellow - no healthy upstream
* blue - get back blue

## Step 7: Override Mesh IP Preference
Currently a mesh IP preference of `IPv6_ONLY` has been set causing the red, orange, and yellow services unable to respond to traffic. In order to address this we can override the mesh IP preference by setting an IP preference at the virtual node level.

Let's change the preference to `IPv4_PREFERRED` for the red and orange services and `IPv6_PREFERRED` for the yellow service by running the one of the following commands depending on your setup.

CloudMap Service Discovery
```bash
./deploy.sh update-mesh cloud override
```

DNS Service Discovery
```bash
./deploy.sh update-mesh dns override
```

Now with this change in place let us send traffic to the service.

Try 
```bash
curl "${COLORAPP_ENDPOINT}/red"
```
 and see if the service correctly gives you the color red back.

**Why did this request succeed?**
The red service is discoverable via IPv4 and the virtual gateway can send it traffic given the virtual node preference of `IPv4_PREFERRED` overrides the mesh preference making it this virtual node discoverable. Once the Envoy recieves the request it will send the request to the application via an IPv4 address. This address is compatible with the application because it can recieve IPv4 traffic.

Try 
```bash
curl "${COLORAPP_ENDPOINT}/orange"
```
 and see if the service correctly gives you the color orange back.

**Why did this request succeed?**
The orange service is discoverable via IPv4 and the virtual gateway can send it traffic given the virtual node preference of `IPv4_PREFERRED` overrides the mesh preference making it this virtual node discoverable. Once the Envoy recieves the request it will send the request to the application via an IPv4 address. This address is compatible with the application because it can recieve IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.

Try 
```bash
curl "${COLORAPP_ENDPOINT}/yellow"
```
 and see if the service correctly gives you the color yellow back.

**Why did this request succeed?**
The yellow service is discoverable via IPv4 and the virtual gateway can send it traffic given the virtual node preference of `IPv6_PREFERRED` overrides the mesh preference making it this virtual node discoverable. Once the Envoy recieves the request it will send the request to the application via an IPv6 address. This address is compatible with the application because it can recieve IPv6 traffic.

## Step 8: Experiment with Different Preferences
Now that we have made changes to both the mesh and virtual node IP preferences it is time to experiment. Updating the mesh and virtual node preferences you can test and see how the preferences impact the traffic being sent to each service.

Like in previous steps, we will deploy updates to the mesh using CloudFormation. Make changes to the mesh and virtual nodes in the `custom-preference.yaml` file. This file will be in a folder for your respective setup. `/cloud/mesh/custom-preference.yaml` for Cloud Map service discovery and `/dns/mesh/custom-preference.yaml` for DNS service discovery.

Once you are finished making changes to your App Mesh resources we can deploy these changes using the following command.

CloudMap Service Discovery
```bash
./deploy.sh update-mesh cloud custom
```

DNS Service Discovery
```bash
./deploy.sh update-mesh dns custom
```

Once the changes have been deployed you can send traffic to each of your services to see their effect. Additionally you can repeat this process to see test other combindations of preferences.

## Step 9: (Optional) Sending IPv6 Traffic to the Virtual Gateway
Up until this point, IPv4 has been used to communicate between the load balancer and the virtual gateway. This is due to the load balancer target group that has been used when sending traffic with the commands such as below.
```bash
curl "${COLORAPP_ENDPOINT}/red"
```
The target group being used here is an IPv4 target group and an IPv6 target group needs to be used to send IPv6 traffic to the virtual gateway from the load balancer.

An IPv6 target group has been already created on the load balancer which can facilitate using IPv6. However, this will require some additional configuration before this IPv6 target group can be used.

First we will need to get the IPv6 address of the virtual gateway task. This can by following the following steps in the [ECS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs).

1. Find and click on the ECS cluster named `app-mesh-ipv6` in the list of clusters.
2. Find and click on the virtual gateway service in the list of services. The name of the service will either be `app-mesh-ipv6-cloud-ecs-service-ColorGatewayService-ECS_SERVICE_SUFFIX` or `app-mesh-ipv6-dns-ecs-service-ColorGatewayService-ECS_SERVICE_SUFFIX` depending on which setup you have. 
3. Click on the Tasks tab and click on the single task running for the service.
4. Under the network section find the IPv6 address field and copy that address down. If there is no address present then make sure you have completed step 4 in the prequisites section of this walkthrough. If you redeploy the gateway service and this task still does not have an IPv6 address then there might be other issues. For troubleshooting this you can take a look at the following which outlines the requirements for Fargate tasks to be assigned IPv6 addresses: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/fargate-task-networking.html#fargate-task-networking-vpc-dual-stack

Now that we have the IPv6 address of the virtual gateway we can now register this address with the load balancer's IPv6 target group. Navigate to the [EC2 Console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2) and follow these steps.

1. Find and click on Target Groups under the Load Balancing.
2. Find and click on the IPv6 target group. Depending on which setup you are using it will either be named `app-mesh-ipv6-web-cloud-ipv6` or `app-mesh-ipv6-web-dns-ipv6`.
3. There should be no registered targets for this target group. Let us now register a target for the virtual gateway. Click on `Register targets` to do so.
4. Under the Step 2 there will be a field to fill out for `IPv6 address`. Put the IPv6 address saved earlier here. Now change the `Ports` field from `81` to `9080`. Once this is done click on `Including as pending below`. Finally click on `Register pending targets` to complete the target registration.

**Note: This registration process needs to be repeated if you deploy a new ECS task for the virtual gateway because the IP address will change. This will cause the target to be referencing the old IP address which would need to be updated.**

With the target registered we can now send traffic to this target group. This can be done by specifying the port 81 which is being used for the IPv6 target group for this load balancer. 

**Note: It may take some time before you can execute this command. The target group needs to initialize the target that you just registered. It will be in an initializing state some time before it changes state to either `healthy` or `unhealthy`. If the state is healthy then you can execute the following command. Otherwise, if the state is `unhealthy` then either the wrong IPv6 address was registered or there is a problem with the virtual getway task.**

Send traffic to this port using this command
```bash
curl "${COLORAPP_ENDPOINT}:81/red"
```
The response will be the color red assuming that nothing has changed with the mesh and virtual nodes since the previous step.

## Step 10: Clean Up

Run the following commands to clean up and tear down the resources that weâ€™ve created.

Delete the CloudMap service discovery setup if you deployed it:
```bash
./deploy.sh delete-cloud-service
```

Delete the DNS service discovery setup if you deployed it:
```bash
./deploy.sh delete-dns-service
```

Delete the infrastructure after you have torn down your setup(s):
```bash
./deploy.sh delete-infra
```

## Appendix 

Envoy configuration changes based on IP Preference setting

**Service Discovery: DNS**: the `dns_lookup_family` value will be based on the IP preference setting used.    

|IP preference	|dns_lookup_family	|
|---	|---	|
|`No Preference` | AUTO (prefer IPv6 and fall back to IPv4 )  |
|`IPv4_PREFERRED` | V4_PREFERRED |
|`IPv6_PREFERRED` | AUTO  |
|`IPv4_ONLY` | V4_ONLY  |
|`IPv6_ONLY` | V6_ONLY |


```
# DNS Resolution Preference*      
      
type: LOGICAL_DNS
connect_timeout: 1s
# Determines how the Envoy will perform DNS resolution for this cluster. The default is AUTO which is to prefer IPv6 and fall back to IPv4 
dns_lookup_family: V6_ONLY    
load_assignment:
  cluster_name: cds_egress_bookstore_reviews-v1-${scenarioSuffix}_http_8020
  endpoints:
    - lb_endpoints:
      - endpoint:
          address:
            socket_address:
              address: reviews-v1.internal
              port_value: 8020
```
**Service Discovery: AWS Cloud Map**:   
Example: An IPv6 address will be used if IP preference is set as `IPv6_PREFERRED` and an IPv6 address is registered in Cloud Map.

```
# ClouMap IP Preference*     
     
endpoints:
- lb_endpoints:
  - endpoint:
      address:
        socket_address:
          # The IP address we populate using IPs from Cloud Map. By default we prefer IPv4 and fall back to IPv6 for when no IP preference is applied.
          address: 2001:0db8:85a3:ab34:12cd:abcd:0001:2345    
          port_value: 8080
```

**Envoy Listener Configuration: Binding Address (Ingress/Egress)**: the Envoy's listeners will accept all IPv4 and IPv6 traffic if and IP preference is set.

```
address:
  socket_address:
    # *::* binds for all IPv6 addresses, by default it is 0.0.0.0
    address: :: 
    # Configures this listener to also bind to all IPv4 addresses when binding to *::*. This is false by default.
    ipv4_compat: true     
    # Port number depends on ingress or egress listener. 
    port_value: 15000/15001 
```

**Envoy Cluster Configuration: Local Application Address**: Envoy will use 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 as the address for the endpoint representing the local application if IP preference is set as `IPv6_ONLY` or `IPv6_PREFERRED`. Otherwise it will be 127.0.0.1 for `IPv4_ONLY`, `IPv4_PREFERRED`, and no preference.
```
